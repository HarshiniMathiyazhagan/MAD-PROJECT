# MAD-PROJECT
This project is an AI-powered skincare recommendation application that provides personalized skincare suggestions based on user-uploaded images. The app leverages deep learning for skin type prediction and content-based filtering for recommending skincare products.

Features
Skin Type Prediction: Classifies skin types using MobileNet, a lightweight convolutional neural network fine-tuned on the Dermnet dataset.
Personalized Recommendations: Recommends skincare products tailored to the user's skin type and condition.
User-Friendly Interface: Allows users to upload images easily and get real-time recommendations.
Feedback Mechanism: Integrates user feedback for continuous model improvement.
Additional Features: Includes skincare tips and advice for better skin health.
Technology Stack
Programming Languages: Python (backend), Java/Kotlin (mobile application)
Frameworks & Libraries: TensorFlow, MobileNet, OpenCV
Dataset: Dermnet dataset for skin type classification
Platform: Android Studio for mobile application development
How It Works
Users upload an image of their skin via the app.
The image is analyzed using the MobileNet model to predict the user's skin type.
Based on the prediction, the app recommends suitable skincare products using content-based filtering.
Users can provide feedback on recommendations, which helps improve the system.
Achievements
Presented at the SRM Model Competition and received a certificate of recognition for innovation and implementation.
