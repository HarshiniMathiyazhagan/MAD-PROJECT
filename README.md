# MAD-PROJECT
# AI-Powered Skincare Recommendation Application

This application leverages AI to provide **personalized skincare suggestions** based on user-uploaded skin images. It uses **deep learning** for skin type prediction and **content-based filtering** for tailored product recommendations.

## Features

- **Skin Type Prediction**:  
  Classifies skin types using MobileNet, a lightweight convolutional neural network fine-tuned on the Dermnet dataset.

- **Personalized Recommendations**:  
  Recommends skincare products tailored to the user's skin type and condition.

- **User-Friendly Interface**:  
  Allows users to upload images easily and get real-time recommendations.

- **Feedback Mechanism**:  
  Integrates user feedback for continuous model improvement.

- **Additional Features**:  
  Includes skincare tips and advice for better skin health.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Languages**: Python (backend), Java/Kotlin (mobile application)
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: TensorFlow, MobileNet, OpenCV
- **Dataset**: Dermnet dataset for skin type classification
- **Platform**: Android Studio for mobile application development

## How It Works

1. Users upload a skin image via the app.
2. The image is analyzed by the MobileNet model to predict the userâ€™s skin type.
3. Based on the prediction, the app recommends suitable skincare products using content-based filtering.
4. Users can provide feedback on recommendations, which helps improve the system.

## Achievements

- **Presented at the SRM Model Competition**  
  Received a certificate of recognition for innovation and implementation.
